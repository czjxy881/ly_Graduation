随着Android设备的进一步普及，传统点触式交互方式已无法满足当今需求。人们日益期待一种解放双手的人机交互模式，基于手势识别的人机交互便应运而生。

而对于普通拍照应用，特别是自拍，人们更加渴望一种无需接触即可拍照的模式。本文便着力于这一需求，提出了一种手机拍照手势识别算法。

本文首先介绍了下Android,OpenCV的相关知识。随后重点叙述了算法中的几个关键技术，如图像预处理，手势特征提取，线程冲突解决等。接着我们详细介绍了算法的设计与实现，从手势选取，识别流程到算法封装发布，并验证了其理论可行性。最后，我们利用前文的手势识别算法编写了一个自拍相机Demo，通过实验证明其具有实际可用性。

With the further popularization of Android devices, the traditional touch-based interaction has been unable to meet the needs of today. People increasingly expect a hands free interactive mode, based on human-computer interaction gesture recognition have come into being.

For ordinary camera applications, particularly the self-timer, a no-contact with people more eager to take the picture mode. This article will focus on this need, a new camera phone gesture recognition algorithm.

This paper introduces the relevant knowledge under Android and OpenCV's. Then focus on the algorithm described in several key technologies, such as image preprocessing, feature extraction gesture, thread conflict resolution. Then we detail the design and implementation of the algorithm, selected from gesture recognition algorithm processes to release the package, and to verify the feasibility of the theory. Finally, we use gesture recognition algorithm previously written a self-timer camera Demo, proved by its practical usability.
